# Speech Source Separation on LibriSpeech Dataset

This repository contains Python code for performing speech source separation on the LibriSpeech dataset using different techniques including Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), among others.

The LibriSpeech dataset is a corpus of read speech derived from audiobooks in the public domain, which is suitable for various speech processing tasks including source separation.

This repository assumes the presence of the LibriSpeech dataset. You should have the dataset available locally or specify the path to the dataset within the scripts. The dataset can be downloaded from LibriSpeech.
## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `soundfile`
- `librosa`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`. For example:
```bash
pip install numpy soundfile librosa scikit-learn tensorflow
